# Chroma Likes Colors

Chroma is a bot that plays an online color game called [dull](https://jessicaup.github.io/dull/).
dull is made by another fantastic developer, you can check out her stuff [here](https://github.com/jessicaUP).

Chroma is made using selenium, she is one of the few bots I've made. (as of right now the only one I've put on github)
